        <h3>Cooking with my family</h3>
        <p>
       Ever since I was a little girl, I remember helping around when my mom and sisters got to cook for the entire family (sometimes even my sisters families) for dinner at least once a week. I enjoyed their company since they got to sing, joke and have fun together as they were preparing the family dinner. One of the best meals I've learned how to cook from my mom was the Pollo Guisado recipe, which I have shared on the link above.</p>
          <p>This tradition continued until we moved away from the area and my sisters also moved away for work or school reasons. In my home we continued to prepare meals for us and whoever we had as special guest. The recipes my mom made are to this day the best Guatemalan food eve, and now in our own families as we are all married, continue to prepare those meals with the special recipes my mom made for us. </p>

        <h3>Special memories</h3>
        <p>
        My mom was always learning new things to make and do to sell and provide for the family. She knows how to: 
          <ul>
            <li>sew,</li>
              <li>knit,</li> 
                <li>crochet,</li> 
                  <li>bake, </li>
                    <li>she is a nurse, 
                      <li>a midwife a handywoman,</li>
            <li>etc. </li><br>
            I realy don't know if there is anything she can't do. But I remember growing up in a house that always smelled like food, I mean always! One of the things I remember the most about her baking, was that I would always lik the bowl where she prepared the dough for cakes, and taking bites of the cakes she made, which would always make her really upset. So she taught me how to do it and how to make my own little cakes. So now I try to show my babies where their meals and deserts come from, with help from my husband and sometimes my parents and siblings, and they love to see how it all comes together and of course to eat what I prepare.<br>
