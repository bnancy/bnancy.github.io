	    <h1>Bee Nancy Creations</h1>
		<p>Growing up in a family of eight siblings, I was always called the "creative one" - The one that would always be by my mother's side learning and making things with her. This helped my desire to learn more and my passion for creating unique items grew over the years by seing people's reaction to my creations and how they would show their unique personality. As my experience with my own family and close friends has been very accepting, I decided to take a step further and share with everyone what I am pationate about. I hope you will find my creations as unique as you are!!! </p>
