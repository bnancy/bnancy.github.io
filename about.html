		<h4>Be creative, and enjoy life.</h4>
		<p>If you are looking for the perfect gift or the perfect item for your home, look no further! Bee Nancy's Creations has what you are looking for! Like a satisfied customer shared:</p>
		<blockquote>"I have always wanted a pair of slippers for my son that he would be comfortable enough to not want to take them off and sure enough I was able to get them from Bee Nancy Creations, they are great!"<br> -Alex</blockquote>
		
		<p>Growing up in a family of eight siblings, I was always called the "creative one" - The one that would always be by my mother's side learning and making things with her. This helped my desire to learn more and my passion for creating unique items grew over the years by seing people's reaction to my creations and how they would show their unique personality. As my experience with my own family and close friends has been very accepting, I decided to take a step further and share with everyone what I am pationate about. I hope you will find my creations as unique as you are!!!</p>
