        <h2>My passion...</h2>

        <p>Growing up in a house of 8 siblings, I was always called the "creative one." Always by my mother's side

            learning every bit of what she did, and she always inspired me to learn and practice what I learned. That's

            why ever since I had my own family, I have always been passionate about creating home made items for my

            young children from knitted beanies and slippers, to leather soft sole shoes and most of all, I enjoy

            creating outfits for them that have not been seen before, or costums that are almost exactly as the

            characters seen on TV with as many details as possible. That's what makes <em>my creations</em> different

            from the rest and I'd like to share them with you and your loved ones.
